# Brain_MRI-Detection

This project is a Streamlit-based application that uses a YOLO11 model to detect MRI regions in medical images. Users can upload MRI images, and the model will identify and highlight relevant regions.

## Features
- Upload MRI images in JPG, JPEG, or PNG formats
- Perform object detection using a YOLO11 model
- Display detected MRI regions with bounding boxes
- Extract and show cropped MRI regions separately
- Adjustable confidence threshold for predictions

## Requirements
Make sure you have the following dependencies installed:
